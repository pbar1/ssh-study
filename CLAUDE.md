I'm studying SSH implementations in pursuit of learning the best practices of how it is implemented so that I can implement from scratch myself. I've cloned a few repositories as Git submodules and want to compare and contrast them to extract knowledge.

Here is an index of the top level repositories that we are studying:

`libssh`: An SSH library in C with both client and server
`libssh2`: An SSH library in C with client only
`openssh-portable`: An SSH binary in C that is both client and server. This is essentially the SSH reference implementation.
`russh`: An SSH library in Rust with both client and server
`asyncssh`: An SSH library in Python with both client and server
